<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Inspired by https://github.com/richardregeer/phpunit-coverage-check

This project is a console command that filters the coverage report of your Phpunit tests to only take into account the 
modifications of a PullRequest, so you can be sure that the PR has enough tests.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

Make sure Composer is installed globally, as explained in the
[installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute:

```console
$ composer require --dev orbeji/phpunit-pr-coverage-check
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
There are two ways of using this command:
* Passing a diff file
* Passing git repo information

With the first option you need to generate the appropiate diff file to pass to the command.
The diff file must only contain the modified files/lines of the pr. To do that you can call
`git diff DESTINATION_BRANCH...PR_BRANCH > diff.txt` with 
[Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/variables-and-secrets/) and 
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables) 
you have environment variables to know 
the current and destination branches.

Diff file example:
Bitbucket
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-clover clover.xml
git diff ${BITBUCKET_PR_DESTINATION_BRANCH}...${BITBUCKET_BRANCH} > diff.txt
vendor/bin/pr-coverage-check check clover.xml 100 --diff=diff.txt
```
GitHub
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-clover clover.xml
git diff ${BITBUCKET_PR_DESTINATION_BRANCH}...${BITBUCKET_BRANCH} > diff.txt
vendor/bin/pr-coverage-check check clover.xml 100 --diff=diff.txt
```
Git repo information
```bash
vendor/bin/pr-coverage-check check clover.xml 100 --pullrequest-id=1 --provider=Github --workspace=orbeji --repository=test --api_token=API_TOKEN 
```
The API token must have permissions to the PullRequest scope.

For GitHub in the workspace option put the owner of the repo.

In any case if the coverage is not met the command will return the covered percentage
```bash
Coverage 40%
 ```

### Reports
When executing the command line you can pass the option `--report` to generate a table with the uncovered lines of the PR

This option accepts 3 values:
* ansi: Coverage table in console output
* comment: Coverage table in PR comment
* report: Bitbucket report

#### Examples:
ansi:
```
root@bbfb2d246e64:/app# bin/pr-coverage-check check tests/clover.xml 90 --diff=tests/diff.txt --report=ansi
Coverage: 40%
--------------- ------------ 
File            Uncovered Lines
--------------- ------------ 
src/Dummy.php   19, 20, 26
--------------- ------------ 
```
